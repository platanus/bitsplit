# Bitsplit [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/bitsplit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/bitsplit)
This is a Rails application, initially generated using [Potassium](https://github.com/platanus/potassium) by Platanus.

## Servidor de Staging
https://pl-bitsplit-staging.herokuapp.com/


## Local installation

Assuming you've just cloned the repo, run this script to setup the project in your
machine:

    $ ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Node.js, Docker and make.

The script will do the following among other things:

- Install the dependecies
- Create a docker container for your database
- Prepare your database
- Adds heroku remotes

After the app setup is done you can run it with [Heroku Local]

    $ heroku local

[Heroku Local]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local


## Deployment

This project is pre-configured to be (easily) deployed to Heroku servers, but needs you to have the Potassium binary installed. If you don't, then run:

    $ gem install potassium

Then, make sure you are logged in to the Heroku account where you want to create the app and run

    $ potassium install heroku --force

this will create the app on heroku, create a pipeline and link the app to the pipeline.

You'll still have to manually log in to the heroku dahsboard, go to the new pipeline and 'configure automatic deploys' using Github
You can run the following command to open the dashboard in the pipeline page

    $ heroku pipelines:open

Remember to connect each stage to the corresponding branch:

1. Staging -> Master
2. Production -> Production

That's it. You should already have a running app and each time you push to the corresponding branch, the system will (hopefully) update accordingly.


## Continuous Integrations

The project is setup to run tests
in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/bitsplit/tree/master)

You can also run the test locally simulating the production environment using docker.
Just make sure you have docker installed and run:

    bin/cibuild


## Style Guides

The style guides are enforced through a self hosted version of [Hound CI](http://monkeyci.platan.us). The style configuration can also be used locally
in development runing `rubocop` or just using the rubocop integration for your text editor of choice.

You can add custom rules to this project just adding them to the `.ruby-style.yml` file.


## Seeds

To populate your database with initial data you can add, inside the `/db/seeds.rb` file, the code to generate **only the necessary data** to run the application.
If you need to generate data with **development purposes**, you can customize the `lib/fake_data_loader.rb` module and then to run the `rake load_fake_data` task from your terminal.


## Internal dependencies

### Authentication

We are using the great [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) library by [PlataformaTec](http://plataformatec.com.br/)

### Rails pattern enforcing types

This projects uses [Power-Types](https://github.com/platanus/power-types) to generate Services, Commands, Utils and Values.

## Development

For hot-reloading and fast webpacker compilation you need to run webpack's dev server along with the rails server:

    $ ./bin/webpack-dev-server

Running the dev server will also solve problems with the cache not refreshing between changes and provide better error messages if something fails to compile.

For even faster in-place component refreshing (with no page reloads), you can enable Hot Module Reloading in `config/webpacker.yml`

    development:
      dev_server:
        hmr: true
